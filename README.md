# Augimals
An augmented reality assistive technology designed to help young people with Autism.

This educational game will help people with Autism recognise emotions and help them with having eye contact with other people.

The game modes:

Game mode 1 - Animal Masks
A mask will appear over a guardian's face and slowly fade away.
The young person will get more points the longer they look at the mask, this incentivises the young person to look at
people and make eye contact, which is a common struggle for people with Autism.

Game mode 2 - Emotion Masks
A mask will appear over a guardian's face and the young person will have to identify the emotion that they are displaying.
This incentivises making eye contact whilst also encouraging learning more about emotions, another common struggle for people
with Autism.

Game mode 3 - Emotion Snap
Each player will have some cards and then they will play snap with them. Rather than using the image on the card we will use
AR to display the emotion but on different animals, this makes the young person understand the difference between finding the
same image and more about the face that is being shown on each animal. This will encourage the young person to look out for these
emotions in every day life.

Game mode 4 - Emotion Grid
When the deck of cards is scanned by the AR camera, a grid of different emotions on different animals will appear.
In the bottom left is a prompt of what emotion the young person has to find in the grid, this may be on the same or different
animals, once again encouraging them to look at the face being shown and the fine details rather than copying the image.

We found that these two issues are the most common and most disruptive to everyday life for people with Autism and we created
these game modes to attempt to improve their situation for them whilst allowing them to have fun.
